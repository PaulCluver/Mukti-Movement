<div class="well">
	<p> 
		At Mukti movement, we offer classes in Ba Gua Zhang. Ba Gua Zhang Kung Fu is a mind / body practice in which one seeks to understand the universal principle of change through the harmonious interplay of movement, breath and intention. Our Kung Fu classes teach one to flow with the change and find a place of stillness and balance whenever change occurs.
	</p>

	<p>
		A fundamental part of this Kung Fu is the practice of Zhan Zhuang Chi Gung. This Chi Gung is centered around the study of 8 fundamental standing postures. Like Hatha yoga, each Chi Gung posture has precise structural and mental requirements. In learning to understand one's body and it's potential for movement, the logical progression from the static Chi Gung postures is to investigate how each one can be used when moving, changing direction and issuing or absorbing force.

	<p>
		Our Ba Gua Zhang Kung Fu classes always starts with a gentle warm-up where we prepare the body and mind for the practice by working through a variety of movement sequences. Following this, we practice standing Chi Gung. Pre-defined, static postures are held for extended periods of time in an effort to train the stabilising function of our postural muscles. Each of these postures is representative of a specific force which we ultimately seek to employ in both movement and interaction with a partner. This movement and partner work is facilitated through the practice of Ba Gua Zhang Kung Fu's circle walking and palm methods. The practice is always closed by performing some basic restorative stretching and breathing techniques.
