                    Vinyasa yoga, in which movement is synchronized to the breath, is a term that covers a broad range of yoga classes. This style is sometimes also called flow yoga, because of the smooth way that the poses run together and become like a dance. The breath becomes an important component because the teacher will instruct you to move from one pose to the next on an inhale or an exhale. Vinyasa is literally means "connection," between movement and breath.

                    <p>
                        Through the practice of Ashtanga and Vinyasa yoga we gain control of the senses and a deep awareness of our selves. By maintaining this discipline with regularity one acquires steadiness of body and mind.
