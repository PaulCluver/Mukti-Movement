        Ba Gua Zhang Kung Fu is a powerful martial art which occupies the middle ground between the apparent softness of Tai Chi Chuan and the seemingly hard nature of Xing Yi Chuan.  The martial art of Ba Gua Zhang Kung Fu posseses a sinuous and aerobic quality that is imbued with continuous changes and rapidly spiralling complex motions. Being thoroughly grounded in the philosophy of the I Ching, this unique Kung Fu teaches one to flow with change and find a place of balance and stillness whenever transformation occurs.

                    Yin Style Baguazhang is an art of striking while moving. It is a combative art with precise theoretical and technical qualities. The fighting theory and usage, outward appearance, and internal development methods all originate from and accord with a classic of ancient Chinese philosophy known as the Book of Changes. It is this philosophy which gives us the rules of the circle and square. In Yin Stlye Bagua, we turn round and strike square. In accord with the symbolism and meaning of the eight trigrams in the Book of Changes, Yin Style Bagua has eight distinct systems within the art. Each of these systems, represented by a trigram and particular animal, stands on its own as a complete martial art with unique developmental and fighting methods.

                    <p>
                        Yin Style Bagua emphasizes developing the mind and body together - it is equal parts mental and physical. Training this art will make you stronger, healthier, and a more skilled fighter.
